#Since we want to read all images, the "frames" variable is not set to any value
#To read one frame, set "frames" equal to that frame number
#To read frames within a range, set "frames" equal to "<start_frame> , <end_frame>"
#To read frames within a range with an effective frame rate, set "frames" equal to "<start_frame> , <end_frame> , <# of frames to skip>"
